Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban
fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.
“We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” said the Minister of Magic,
Cornelius Fudge, this morning, “and we beg the magical community to remain
calm.”       Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International
Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.
“Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said an irritable Fudge. “Black is
mad. He’s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime
Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black’s true identity to
anyone. And let’s face it — who’d believe him if he did?” While Muggles have
been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to
kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of
twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse.
